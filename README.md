# Openbud
When an open source project starts, it is normally accompanied by a single person and only when that person does a lot of work and gets the project up and running, do other open source contributors come to contribute. This project is to help these early projects to find other interested contributors to help when the project is in its early stage itself, also when a different contributor proposes similar kind of project, he will be mapped to other projects that might be similar, so that he can join them.
